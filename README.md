# CNN_Classifier
Basic walk through of CNN Image classification on the popular "Dogs vs Cats" dataset

To cover the basics of Deep-Learning, a self-walkthrough was made to cover the aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks, the DL equivalent of the standard classifier.
This was one of the initial workbooks prior to beginning on the later, bigger project: the U-NET tumor diagnoser.
